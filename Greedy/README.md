# Greedy Algorithms ðŸ’°

## What This Topic Covers
Greedy algorithm design paradigm. This section covers:
- Greedy choice property
- Optimal substructure in greedy problems
- Activity selection and scheduling
- Proof techniques for greedy correctness

## Common Problems & Patterns
- **Activity Selection** - Scheduling non-overlapping activities
- **Fractional Knapsack** - Continuous optimization problems
- **Huffman Coding** - Optimal prefix-free codes
- **Minimum Spanning Tree** - Kruskal's and Prim's algorithms
- **Interval Scheduling** - Meeting room and job scheduling
- **Gas Station** - Circular route problems
- **Jump Game** - Greedy traversal problems

## Implementation Notes
Solutions are written in **Java** with clean, optimized implementations focusing on:
- Sorting-based greedy approaches
- Priority queue implementations for greedy selection
- Proof of correctness for greedy choices
- Comparison with DP alternatives where applicable
