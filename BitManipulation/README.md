# Bit Manipulation 🔢

## What This Topic Covers
Bitwise operations and bit-level programming techniques. This section covers:
- Basic bitwise operators (AND, OR, XOR, NOT, shifts)
- Bit manipulation tricks and optimizations
- Binary representation problems
- Bit masking techniques

# Problems Solved

| Problem | Platform | Difficulty | Summary |
|---------|----------|------------|----------|
| [717. 1-bit and 2-bit Characters](./OneBitAndTwoBitCharacters.java) | LeetCode | Easy | determine whether the last character must be a 1-bit character |
| [1018. Binary Prefix Divisible By 5](./BinaryPrefixDivisibleBy5.java) | LeetCode | Easy | Define xi as the number represented by the binary prefix nums[0..i]. Return an array where answer[i] is true if xi is divisible by 5. |
| [3315. Construct the Minimum Bitwise Array II](./ConstructMinimumBitwiseArray.java) | LeetCode | Medium | find first 1 from back and make it 0 |
