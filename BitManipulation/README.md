# Bit Manipulation ðŸ”¢

## What This Topic Covers
Bitwise operations and bit-level programming techniques. This section covers:
- Basic bitwise operators (AND, OR, XOR, NOT, shifts)
- Bit manipulation tricks and optimizations
- Binary representation problems
- Bit masking techniques

## Common Problems & Patterns
- **Single Number** - Finding unique elements using XOR
- **Power of Two** - Bit manipulation checks
- **Bit Counting** - Hamming weight and set bit counting
- **Subset Generation** - Using bitmasks for combinations
- **Binary Addition** - Bit-level arithmetic operations
- **Reverse Bits** - Bit reversal algorithms
- **Missing Number** - XOR-based solutions

## Implementation Notes
Solutions are written in **Java** with clean, optimized implementations focusing on:
- Efficient bitwise operation usage
- Understanding of binary representation
- Bit manipulation optimization techniques
- Logical reasoning behind bit operations
