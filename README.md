### Re-Exploring My DSA Path 🚀

I've decided to revisit and deepen my journey through Data Structures & Algorithms. This time, I'm starting afresh—with new perspective and intent—to master concepts in a structured, phase-wise manner. 

#### **Current Focus: Just Beginning My Dynamic Programming Journey**
- [x] Got through the basics and the core ideas of DP
- [x] Still to solidify more patterns (many are new for me!) [Started DP on Strings](./DynamicProgramming/Longest_Common_SubSequence_AND_VARIANTS/EditDistance.java)
- [ ] Advanced topics, optimizations, and state reductions coming up
- [ ] Lining up a period of intensive DP coding practice to master the field

*This is just a decent start—lots of exciting DP and optimization concepts to visit next! Big coding grind ahead!*

*Progress: ◉◉◎◎ — Some solid growth in DP already, but much more depth to reach!*

#### **Next Up: Revisiting the World of Graphs**
- [x] Refresh fundamentals—graph traversals and manipulations [Basic Algorithms](./Graphs)
- [x] Practice shortest paths, connected components 
- [ ] Explore trees in detail: traversals, BSTs, heap ops
- [ ] Key interview applications

#### **Future Steps: Advanced Tree Topics & Beyond**
- [ ] Master Fenwick Trees (Binary Indexed Trees), Segment Trees
- [ ] Advanced tricks: persistent data structures, union-find
- [ ] Dive into even more specialized topics (trie, suffix trees etc.)

#### **Phase on the Horizon: Specialized & Real-World Applications**
- [ ] Bit manipulation and tricky operations
- [ ] Sliding window, two pointer techniques, prefix/suffix sums
- [ ] Greedy, optimization, and advanced graph techniques
- [ ] System/architecture-oriented problem solving

---
*This path is about depth, not speed—reexploring, relearning, and conquering one foundational block at a time! Currently building momentum with DP, then forging onward to graphs, trees (including Fenwick, Segment Trees), and more specialized topics step-by-step.*
