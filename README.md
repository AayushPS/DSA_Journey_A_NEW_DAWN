## 🎯 Learning Journey

### Current Phase: Advanced Dynamic Programming & Optimization Mastery

I'm on a mission to **master DSA concepts** through structured, phase-wise learning:

**Current Focus Areas:**
- ✅ DP fundamentals and core concepts solidified
- ✅ Diverse DP patterns mastered (Grids, Strings, LIS Variants, LCS)
- 🔄 Exploring Tree DP and Knapsack Variants with hierarchical optimization
- 📚 Building advanced techniques foundation with discount/cost propagation strategies
- 🎯 Preparing for real-world problem solving with complex DP scenarios

**Progress Indicators:**
- DP Coverage: ◉◉◉◉ - Comprehensive coverage with advanced patterns
- Arrays & Basics: ◉◉◉◉ - Well-established foundation
- Overall DSA: ◉◉◉◎ - Strong growth trajectory with depth focus

### Next Phases on the Horizon

**Phase 2: Graph Mastery** 🌐
- [ ] Traverse all graph patterns (DFS, BFS, Dijkstra, etc.)
- [ ] Master shortest path algorithms
- [ ] Solve connected component problems
- [ ] Explore topological sorting and tree algorithms

**Phase 3: Advanced Trees & Data Structures** 🌳
- [ ] Binary Search Trees and Balancing
- [ ] Fenwick Trees and Segment Trees
- [ ] Trie and Suffix Trees
- [ ] Union-Find and Advanced Structures

**Phase 4: Specialized Topics** ⚡
- [ ] Bit manipulation techniques
- [ ] Sliding window and two-pointer optimization
- [ ] Greedy algorithms and proof strategies
- [ ] System design and real-world applications

> **Philosophy**: Depth over speed. Master each concept thoroughly before moving forward. Quality solutions over quantity.
