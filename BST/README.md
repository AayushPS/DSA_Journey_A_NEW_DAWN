# Binary Search Tree (BST) üîç

## What This Topic Covers
Binary Search Tree properties and operations. This section covers:
- BST insertion, deletion, and search
- BST validation and construction
- In-order successor/predecessor
- Self-balancing tree concepts

## Common Problems & Patterns
- **BST Validation** - Checking if tree maintains BST property
- **Search & Insert** - Efficient BST operations
- **BST to Sorted Array** - In-order traversal applications
- **Kth Smallest/Largest** - Order statistics in BST
- **BST Iterator** - In-order traversal without recursion
- **Range Sum Queries** - Sum of nodes in given range
- **BST Construction** - Building BST from various inputs

## Implementation Notes
Solutions are written in **Java** with clean, optimized implementations focusing on:
- BST property maintenance
- Iterative and recursive implementations
- Efficient search and modification operations
- Balance factor considerations
