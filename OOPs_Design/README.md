# Object-Oriented Programming Design & System Simulation 🎭

## What This Topic Covers
Object-oriented design patterns and system simulation problems. This section covers:
- Class design and architecture
- Design patterns (Singleton, Factory, Observer, etc.)
- System simulation and modeling
- Encapsulation and abstraction
- State management in complex systems

## Common Problems & Patterns
- **System Design** - Designing real-world systems using OOP
- **State Machines** - Managing complex states and transitions
- **Event Simulation** - Simulating real-world events and interactions
- **Data Structures Design** - Building custom data structures with OOP
- **Browser History** - Implementing navigation systems
- **Parking Lot** - Designing parking management systems
- **LRU Cache** - Least Recently Used cache implementation

## Problems Solved

| Problem | Platform | Difficulty | Summary |
|---------|----------|------------|---------|
| [2426. Number of Pairs Satisfying Inequality](./Simulation/MaximumBalancedSubsequenceSum.java) | LeetCode | Hard | Design a system to handle queries on subsequence sums with specific balancing conditions |
| [Simple Bank System](./Simulation/SimpleBankSystem.java) | LeetCode | Easy | Implement a simple banking system with basic operations |

## Implementation Notes
Solutions are written in **Java** with focus on:
- Clean OOP principles and design patterns
- Proper encapsulation and access modifiers
- Efficient data structure usage
- Scalable system architecture
- Well-documented class interactions
