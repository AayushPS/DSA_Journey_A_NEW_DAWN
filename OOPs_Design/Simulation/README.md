# OOPs Design & Simulation ðŸŽ­

## What This Topic Covers
Object-oriented design and simulation problems. This section covers:
- Design patterns and system architecture
- Class design and inheritance
- Interface implementation
- Simulation of real-world systems
- State management and behavior modeling

## Common Problems & Patterns
- **Design Data Structures** - Custom data structure implementations (LRU Cache, Min Stack)
- **System Design** - Designing parking lots, libraries, elevators
- **Game Simulation** - Board games, card games, tic-tac-toe
- **Iterator Pattern** - Custom iterator implementations
- **Factory & Builder** - Object creation patterns
- **State Machines** - Managing complex state transitions
- **Event-Driven Systems** - Queue-based simulations

## Problems Solved

| Problem | Platform | Difficulty | Summary |
|---------|----------|------------|----------|
| [2043. Simple Bank System](./SimpleBankSystem.java) | LeetCode | Medium | Implement a banking system with deposit, withdraw, and transfer operations |

## Implementation Notes
Solutions are written in **Java** with clean, optimized implementations focusing on:
- Proper OOP principles (encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism)
- Design pattern application
- Clean class hierarchy and interface design
- Maintainable and extensible code
