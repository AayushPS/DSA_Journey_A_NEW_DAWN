# Arrays 📊

## What This Topic Covers
Arrays are one of the fundamental data structures in computer science. This section covers:
- Static and dynamic arrays
- Array manipulation techniques
- Index-based operations
- Memory-efficient algorithms

## Common Problems & Patterns
- **Two Sum variants** - Finding pairs with target sum
- **Sliding Window** - Maximum/minimum in subarrays
- **Kadane's Algorithm** - Maximum subarray sum
- **Dutch National Flag** - Three-way partitioning
- **Merge Intervals** - Overlapping intervals problems
- **Rotate Array** - Cyclic rotations and reversals
- **Search & Sort** - Binary search, merge sort variations
