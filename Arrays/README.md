# Arrays ðŸ“Š

## What This Topic Covers
Arrays are one of the fundamental data structures in computer science. This section covers:
- Static and dynamic arrays
- Array manipulation techniques
- Index-based operations
- Memory-efficient algorithms

## Common Problems & Patterns
- **Two Sum variants** - Finding pairs with target sum
- **Sliding Window** - Maximum/minimum in subarrays
- **Kadane's Algorithm** - Maximum subarray sum
- **Dutch National Flag** - Three-way partitioning
- **Merge Intervals** - Overlapping intervals problems
- **Rotate Array** - Cyclic rotations and reversals
- **Search & Sort** - Binary search, merge sort variations

## Problems Solved

| Problem | Platform | Difficulty | Summary |
|---------|----------|------------|----------|
| [3349. Adjacent Increasing Subarrays Detection I](./AdjacentIncreasingSubarrays.java) | LeetCode | Easy | Check if two adjacent subarrays of length k are strictly increasing |
| [3350. Adjacent Increasing Subarrays Detection II](./AdjacentIncreasingSubarraysII.java) | LeetCode | Medium | Find the maximum k for which two adjacent subarrays of length k are strictly increasing |
| [2598. Smallest Missing Non-negative Integer After Operations](./SmallestMissingNonNegativeIntegerAfterOperations.java) | LeetCode | Medium | Find the maximum possible MEX after adding/subtracting value from array elements |
| [2125. Number of Laser Beams in a Bank](./NumberOfLaserBeamsInABank.java) | LeetCode | Medium | Count total laser beams between security devices across non-empty rows |

## Implementation Notes
Solutions are written in **Java** with clean, optimized implementations focusing on:
- Time complexity optimization
- Space complexity considerations  
- Edge case handling
- Clean, readable code with proper commenting
