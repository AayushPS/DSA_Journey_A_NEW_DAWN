# Binary Search(BS) 🔍

## What This Topic Covers
Binary Search properties and operations. This section covers:
- BS idea of reduction of search space
- BST validation and construction
- optimization over normal searching
- Self-balancing tree concepts

## Common Problems & Patterns
- **BST Validation** - Checking if tree maintains BST property
- **Search & Insert** - Efficient BST operations
- **BST to Sorted Array** - In-order traversal applications
- **Kth Smallest/Largest** - Order statistics in BST
- **BST Iterator** - In-order traversal without recursion
- **Range Sum Queries** - Sum of nodes in given range
- **BST Construction** - Building BST from various inputs

## Problems Solved

| Problem | Platform | Difficulty | Summary |
|---------|----------|------------|----------|
| [2141. Maximum Running Time of N Computers](./MaximumRunningTimeOfNComputers.java) | LeetCode | Hard | Find answer of maximum running time by reducing search space via binary search |
| [1351. Count Negative Numbers in a Sorted Matrix](./CountNegativeNumbersInASortedMatrix.java) | LeetCode | Easy | find count of negative numbers in a matrix using two pointers and binary search | 

## Implementation Notes
Solutions are written in **Java** with clean, optimized implementations focusing on:
- BST property maintenance
- Iterative and recursive implementations
- Efficient search and modification operations
- Balance factor considerations
