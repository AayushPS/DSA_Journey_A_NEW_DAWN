# Binary Tree ðŸŒ³

## What This Topic Covers
Binary tree data structure and related algorithms. This section covers:
- Binary tree construction and traversal
- Tree property validation
- Path-based problems
- Level-order and depth-first operations

## Common Problems & Patterns
- **Tree Traversals** - Inorder, preorder, postorder (recursive & iterative)
- **Level Order Traversal** - BFS-based tree exploration
- **Path Sum Problems** - Root-to-leaf and any-path sums
- **Tree Diameter** - Longest path between any two nodes
- **Lowest Common Ancestor** - Finding common ancestors
- **Tree Serialization** - Converting tree to/from string
- **Binary Tree Views** - Left, right, top, bottom views

## Implementation Notes
Solutions are written in **Java** with clean, optimized implementations focusing on:
- Proper tree node structure and management
- Recursive and iterative approaches
- Space-efficient traversal techniques
- Edge case handling (null nodes, single nodes)
