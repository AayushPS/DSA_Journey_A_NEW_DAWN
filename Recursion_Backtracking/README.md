# Recursion & Backtracking ðŸ”„

## What This Topic Covers
Recursive problem-solving techniques and backtracking algorithms. This section covers:
- Recursive thinking and base cases
- Divide and conquer strategies
- Backtracking with pruning
- Memoization and optimization techniques

## Common Problems & Patterns
- **Tree Traversals** - Recursive tree exploration
- **Permutations & Combinations** - Generating all possibilities
- **N-Queens Problem** - Classic backtracking example
- **Maze Solving** - Path finding with backtracking
- **Subset Generation** - Power set creation
- **Word Break** - Dictionary-based recursion
- **Palindrome Partitioning** - Recursive string splitting

## Implementation Notes
Solutions are written in **Java** with clean, optimized implementations focusing on:
- Clear recursive structure with proper base cases
- Efficient backtracking with pruning strategies
- Stack overflow prevention techniques
- Time and space complexity analysis
