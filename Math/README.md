# Math for DSA 🔢

## What This Topic Covers
This section focuses on math-based techniques essential for competitive programming and DSA:
- Number theory fundamentals
- Combinatorics and counting principles
- Modular arithmetic techniques
- Fast exponentiation & matrix math
- Factorization and sieve methods
- Math-based optimization patterns

## Common Problems & Patterns

### Number Theory
- GCD / LCM
- Prime generation (sieve)
- Modular arithmetic
- Modular inverse
- Factorization patterns
- Diophantine equations
- CRT

### Combinatorics
- nCr patterns
- Permutations & combinations
- Pascal’s identity
- Inclusion–exclusion
- Catalan-type counts

### Optimized Math Techniques
- Binary exponentiation
- Matrix exponentiation
- Bit manipulation math
- Digit-based math (digit DP foundation)
- Prefix-sum/XOR math tricks

## Problems Solved

| Problem | Platform | Difficulty | Summary |
|---------|----------|------------|----------|
| [1513. Number of Substrings With Only 1s](./NumberOfSubstringsWithOnly1s.java) | LeetCode | Medium | Return the number of substrings that consist ONLY of character '1' |
| [1015. Smallest Integer Divisible by K](./SmallestIntegerDivisibleByK.java) | LeetCode | Medium | return the length of the smallest positive integer n such that: n is divisible by k, n consists only of the digit '1'. If no such integer exists, return -1. |

## Implementation Notes
Solutions are written in **Java** with focus on:
- Modular-safe arithmetic
- Efficient precomputation (sieve, factorial arrays)
- Fast exponentiation patterns
- Space/time-optimized formula derivations
