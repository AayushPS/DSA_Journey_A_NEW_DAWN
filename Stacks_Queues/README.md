# Stacks & Queues ðŸ“š

## What This Topic Covers
Linear data structures with specific access patterns. This section covers:
- Stack (LIFO) operations and applications
- Queue (FIFO) operations and variations
- Priority queues and deques
- Implementation using arrays and linked lists

## Common Problems & Patterns
- **Balanced Parentheses** - Stack-based validation
- **Expression Evaluation** - Infix, postfix, prefix conversions
- **Monotonic Stack/Queue** - Maintaining order properties
- **Next Greater Element** - Using stack for efficient lookups
- **BFS Implementation** - Queue-based graph traversal
- **Sliding Window Maximum** - Deque-based optimization
- **Min/Max Stack** - Stack with O(1) min/max operations

## Implementation Notes
Solutions are written in **Java** with clean, optimized implementations focusing on:
- Efficient stack and queue operations
- Custom implementation when needed
- Space-time complexity optimization
- Real-world application scenarios
