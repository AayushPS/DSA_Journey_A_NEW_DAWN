# Dynamic Programming ðŸ’¡

## What This Topic Covers
Dynamic programming optimization technique. This section covers:
- Overlapping subproblems identification
- Optimal substructure property
- Memoization and tabulation approaches
- State space reduction techniques

## Common Problems & Patterns
- **Fibonacci Variants** - Classic DP introduction problems
- **Longest Common Subsequence** - String/array comparison problems
- **Knapsack Problems** - 0/1, unbounded, and fractional knapsack
- **Coin Change** - Minimum coins and ways to make change
- **Edit Distance** - String transformation problems
- **Maximum Subarray** - Kadane's algorithm and variants
- **Stock Trading** - Buy/sell optimization problems

## Implementation Notes
Solutions are written in **Java** with clean, optimized implementations focusing on:
- Bottom-up and top-down DP approaches
- Space optimization techniques (1D arrays, rolling arrays)
- State transition analysis and recurrence relations
- Time and space complexity optimizations
