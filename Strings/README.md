# Strings 🔤

## What This Topic Covers
String manipulation and processing algorithms. This section covers:
- String traversal and searching
- Pattern matching algorithms
- String transformations
- Character frequency analysis

## Common Problems & Patterns
- **Palindrome Detection** - Checking and creating palindromes
- **Anagrams** - Grouping and validating anagrams
- **Pattern Matching** - KMP, Rabin-Karp algorithms
- **String Reversal** - Word and character-level reversals
- **Substring Problems** - Longest common substring/subsequence
- **String Compression** - Run-length encoding
- **Regular Expressions** - Pattern validation

## Problems Solved

| Problem | Platform | Difficulty | Summary |
|---------|----------|------------|----------|
| [1625. Lexicographically Smallest String After Applying Operations](./LexicographicallySmallestStringAfterApplyingOperations.java) | LeetCode | Medium | Find lexicographically smallest string using BFS with rotation and digit addition operations |
| [2011. Final Value of Variable After Performing Operations](./FinalValueOfVariableAfterPerformingOperations.java) | LeetCode | Easy | Simulate increment/decrement operations on a variable using string parsing |
| [944. Delete Columns to Make Sorted](./DeleteColumnsToMakeSorted.java) | LeetCode | Easy | Select string's columwise char to see columns are sorted or not, and delete columns that don't follow | 
| [955. Delete Columns to Make Sorted II](./DeleteColumnsToMakeSortedII.java) | LeetCode | Medium | Select string's cloumnwise char to see each string is respectively sorted or not, and delete columns that don't make follow | 

## Implementation Notes
Solutions are written in **Java** with clean, optimized implementations focusing on:
- Efficient string manipulation using StringBuilder
- Character-based processing techniques
- Pattern matching optimizations
- Memory-conscious string operations
