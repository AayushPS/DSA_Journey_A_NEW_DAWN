- Graph traversal algorithms
- Shortest path algorithms
- Cycle detection and topological sorting

## Algorithms Coded
| Algorithm | Summary |
|---------|---------|
| [Djkstra](./Djkstra.java) | To find minimum cost to reach all or certain nodes from a given source node |
| [DSU](./DSU.java) | To check Connectivity of nodes in Graph optimally |
| [Krushkal](./Krushkal.java) | To find the optimal MST of the graph and return its cost |
| [Prims](./Prims.java) | To find MST from a given source node and return its cost |
