# Graphs üåê

## What This Topic Covers
Graph data structure and graph algorithms. This section covers:
- Graph representation (adjacency list/matrix)
- Graph traversal algorithms
- Shortest path algorithms
- Cycle detection and topological sorting

## Common Problems & Patterns
- **DFS & BFS** - Graph traversal fundamentals
- **Shortest Path** - Dijkstra's, Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall
- **Topological Sort** - DAG ordering using Kahn's algorithm
- **Cycle Detection** - Finding cycles in directed/undirected graphs
- **Connected Components** - Union-Find and DFS approaches
- **Minimum Spanning Tree** - Kruskal's and Prim's algorithms
- **Graph Coloring** - Bipartite checking and coloring problems

## Implementation Notes
Solutions are written in **Java** with clean, optimized implementations focusing on:
- Efficient graph representation choices
- Recursive and iterative traversal methods
- Path reconstruction techniques
- Complex graph algorithm implementations
