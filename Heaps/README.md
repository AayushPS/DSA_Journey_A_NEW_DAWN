# Heaps ⛰️

## What This Topic Covers
Heap data structure and priority queue applications. This section covers:
- Min-heap and max-heap operations
- Heapify algorithms and heap construction
- Priority queue implementations
- Heap-based sorting techniques

# Problems Solved

| Problem | Platform | Difficulty | Summary |
| [2054. Two Best Non-Overlapping Events](./TwoBestNonOverlappingEvents.java) | LeetCode | Medium | use Priority queue to get aximum value of event to be chosen as 1st for current being as second element |

## Common Problems & Patterns
- **Kth Largest/Smallest** - Using heaps for order statistics
- **Merge K Sorted Arrays** - Multi-way merge with priority queue
- **Top K Elements** - Maintaining top elements efficiently
- **Median Finding** - Two-heap approach for streaming data
- **Task Scheduling** - Priority-based task management
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm** - Shortest path with priority queue
- **Heap Sort** - In-place sorting using heap properties

## Implementation Notes
Solutions are written in **Java** with clean, optimized implementations focusing on:
- Java's PriorityQueue and custom heap implementations
- Heap property maintenance and restoration
- Efficient insertion, deletion, and peek operations
- Custom comparators for different ordering needs
