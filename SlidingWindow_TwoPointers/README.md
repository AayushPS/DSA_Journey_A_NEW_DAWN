# Sliding Window & Two Pointers 🪟

## What This Topic Covers
Sliding window and two-pointer technique patterns. This section covers:
- Fixed and variable size sliding windows
- Two-pointer approach for arrays and strings
- Window expansion and contraction strategies
- Optimization of linear time algorithms

## Common Problems & Patterns
- **Maximum Subarray Sum** - Fixed window size problems
- **Longest Substring** - Variable window with constraints
- **Container With Most Water** - Two-pointer optimization
- **Trapping Rain Water** - Two-pointer height problems
- **Valid Palindrome** - Two-pointer string validation
- **Minimum Window Substring** - Variable window pattern matching
- **Subarray Sum Equals K** - Prefix sum with sliding window

## Problems Solved

| Problem | Platform | Difficulty | Summary |
|---------|----------|------------|----------|
| [3234. Count the Number of Substrings With Dominant Ones](./CountSubstringsWithDominantOnes.java) | LeetCode | Medium | Return the number of substrings with dominant ones. dominant ones are when: (ones in substring) >= (zeros in substring)^2 |
| [Count Subarray with K Odds](./CountSubarrayKOdds.java) | GeeksForGeeks | Medium | find subarrays with k odds by considering subarrays with subarrays that have odds less than k - subarrays that have odds less than k-1 |

## Implementation Notes
Solutions are written in **Java** with clean, optimized implementations focusing on:
- Efficient window maintenance techniques
- Two-pointer movement strategies
- Time complexity optimization from O(n²) to O(n)
- Edge case handling for empty windows/arrays
