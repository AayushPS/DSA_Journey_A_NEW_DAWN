## Problems Solved

| Problem | Platform | Difficulty | Summary |
|---------|----------|------------|----------|
| [2169. Count Operations to Obtain Zero](./CountOperationsToObtainZero.java) | LeetCode | Easy | Count operations to make either num1 or num2 zero by repeatedly subtracting the smaller from the larger |
| [3454. Separate Squares II](./SeparateSquaresII.java) | LeetCode | Very Hard | I don't know, just to complete potd |
| [3510. Minimum Pair Removal to Sort Array II](./MinimumPairRemovalSort.java) | use TreeSet, ll logic in sync to determine what pair to remove witha counter to check if array is still unsorted or not |

## Implementation Notes
Solutions are written in **Java** with clean, optimized implementations focusing on:
- Problem-specific optimization strategies
- Clean object-oriented design when applicable
- Mathematical formula derivations and proofs
- Real-world application considerations
