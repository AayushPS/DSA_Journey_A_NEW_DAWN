# LinkedList ðŸ”—

## What This Topic Covers
Linked list data structures and their variations. This section covers:
- Singly, doubly, and circular linked lists
- Node-based data manipulation
- Pointer/reference management
- Dynamic memory allocation concepts

## Common Problems & Patterns
- **Two Pointer Technique** - Fast and slow pointers
- **Cycle Detection** - Floyd's algorithm (tortoise and hare)
- **List Reversal** - Iterative and recursive approaches
- **Merge Operations** - Merging sorted linked lists
- **Intersection Problems** - Finding common nodes
- **Palindrome Check** - Linked list palindrome validation
- **Remove Duplicates** - Maintaining uniqueness in lists

## Problems Solved

| Problem | Platform | Difficulty | Summary |
|---------|----------|------------|----------|
| [3217. Delete Nodes From Linked List Present in Array](./ DeleteNodesFromLinkedListPresentInArray.java) | LeetCode | Medium | Remove all nodes from the linked list whose values exist in the given array |

## Implementation Notes
Solutions are written in **Java** with clean, optimized implementations focusing on:
- Proper node creation and management
- Edge case handling (empty lists, single nodes)
- Memory-efficient operations
- Recursive and iterative solution approaches
