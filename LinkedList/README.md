# LinkedList 🔗

## What This Topic Covers
Linked list data structures and their variations. This section covers:
- Singly, doubly, and circular linked lists
- Node-based data manipulation
- Pointer/reference management
- Dynamic memory allocation concepts

## Common Problems & Patterns
- **Two Pointer Technique** - Fast and slow pointers
- **Cycle Detection** - Floyd's algorithm (tortoise and hare)
- **List Reversal** - Iterative and recursive approaches
- **Merge Operations** - Merging sorted linked lists
- **Intersection Problems** - Finding common nodes
- **Palindrome Check** - Linked list palindrome validation
- **Remove Duplicates** - Maintaining uniqueness in lists

## Problems Solved

| Problem | Platform | Difficulty | Summary |
|---------|----------|------------|----------|
| [3217. Delete Nodes From Linked List Present in Array](./DeleteNodesFromLinkedListPresentInArray.java) | LeetCode | Medium | Remove all nodes from the linked list whose values exist in the given array |
| [1669. Merge In Between Linked Lists](./MergeInBetweenLinkedLists.java) | LeetCode | Medium | Remove the nodes from index `a` to `b` (inclusive) from `list1` and insert the entire `list2` in their place. |
| [234. Palindrome Linked List](./PalindromeLinkedList.java) | LeetCode | Easy | Determine whether Singly connected Linked List is a palindrome |
| [143. Reorder List](./ReorderList.java) | LeetCode | Medium | Reorder the list as follows: L0 → Ln → L1 → Ln-1 → L2 → Ln-2 → … |
| [1721. Swapping Nodes in a Linked List](./SwappingNodesInALinkedList.java) | LeetCode | Medium | Swap the values of:the kᵗʰ node from the beginning and the kᵗʰ node from the end |

## Implementation Notes
Solutions are written in **Java** with clean, optimized implementations focusing on:
- Proper node creation and management
- Edge case handling (empty lists, single nodes)
- Memory-efficient operations
- Recursive and iterative solution approaches
